     <th class="only">Sustainability in the major sectors of Bayelsa state has been a major result of the “resilience” the Prosperity Government led by Gov. Douye Diri has displayed in its tenure. Firstly, we define sustainability in Government as the ability to tackle problems and create solutions that will be reliable in the long run. This article will solely focus on how the prosperity Government has consciously advanced on the major elements of political sustainability of its state which happen to be the environmental, human, economic
             One of the basic things that could be done to conquer our limitations is the occasional integration of youths in various social activities of interest, in activities like music, art and sports. Luckily, the prosperity government of Bayelsa does not lack in this area. As these gatherings can facilitate solidarity and unity amongst the back bone of our state (youths). Because when youths are left dormant, the risk of an outburst of crime is imminent.
   The potentials of the Bayelsan region can also be materialized territorially. As a humid and water based terrestrial ecosystem, a lot can be achieved from the natural resources here. Tourism can be made a big thing with the Brass/Okpoama boundaries connecting directly with the Atlantic ocean. Dams can also be created to enhance the power sector of the nation.
   The economical nature of the state can also be improved by the financial empowerment of the youths in the form of loans and grants, as it is also important to make sure the person has a business plan on paper. This will not only create jobs, financial independence and general economic growth, but also help reduce criminality, because many prone youths would not be idle, as a result their minds cannot be the devils workshop.
